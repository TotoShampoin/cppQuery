# cppQuery

It's jQuery, but on C++.

Because why tf not :D

(it's nothing more than a bunch of JavaScript calls ported to C++ anyway, so move along)

Right now, there's barely anything. Not even a library output. Just the bare minimum to control the dom, and a main to test it. 

No events either yet.

oh shit, I'll have to port events to C++

help
